## Finish the Functions

Your task is to complete all the functions in list_operations.py so that all tests pass. However, there are some restrictions on how you can implement these functions.

## List Slicing Functions

For the list slicing functions (all but the last two), you are only allowed to use fundamental list operations. Anything that you canâ€™t re-implement in Python is fundamental to the language. Fundamental list operations include:

- List indexing (`some_list[index]`)

- List indexing assignment (`some_list[index] = value`)

- List slicing (`some_list[start:end]`)

- List slicing assignment (`some_list[start:end] = another_list`)

- List index deletion (`del some_list[index]`)

- List slicing deletion (`del some_list[start:end]`)

## List Iteration Functions

For the last two functions, you are allowed to use for loops and built-in Python functions/methods.
